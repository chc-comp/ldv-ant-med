# Linux Device Driver verification problems from SV-COMP

These is a set of medium hardness benchmarks generated by SeaHorn from
Linux Device Drivers (LDV) examples at SV-COMP.

The exact parameters used by SeaHorn have been lost.

The original final name is encoded inside the SMT2 file.

The files are in the Z3 rules-format for CHC and are compressed by gzip.

To run using Z3, use the following command line:

```
$ zcat data/FILE.smt2.gz | z3 -in OPTIONS
```
